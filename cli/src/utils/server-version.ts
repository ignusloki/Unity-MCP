 * The pinned GameDev-MCP-Server version the CLI fetches by default with

 *
 * Kept in LOCKSTEP with the Unity plugin's `ServerVersion` constant in
 *   Unity-MCP-Plugin/Packages/com.ivanmurzak.unity.mcp/Editor/Scripts/McpServerManager.cs
 * so the CLI-downloaded binary and the plugin-downloaded binary can never drift. A drift guard
 * in `tests/server-version.test.ts` reads that C# constant and asserts the two are byte-equal.
 * Override at runtime with `--server-version <v>`.
 *
 * The CLI mirrors the constant rather than reading the `.cs` at runtime because the published npm
 * package ships no plugin sources — the plugin release cadence bumps both in the same PR, and the
 * drift-guard test fails CI if a bump touches only one side.
