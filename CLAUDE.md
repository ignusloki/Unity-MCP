## What This Is

Unity-MCP bridges LLMs (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) with Unity Editor and Runtime via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). Sub-projects: `Unity-MCP-Plugin/` (Unity Editor/Runtime plugin), `cli/`, `Installer/`, `Unity-Tests/`.

The MCP server is NOT in this repo — the plugin consumes the shared [GameDev-MCP-Server](https://github.com/IvanMurzak/GameDev-MCP-Server) (binary `gamedev-mcp-server`, release assets `gamedev-mcp-server-<rid>.zip`, Docker `aigamedeveloper/mcp-server`) — one engine-agnostic server shared by Unity-MCP, Godot-MCP, and Unreal-MCP. The plugin downloads the release pinned by the `ServerVersion` constant in `Unity-MCP-Plugin/Packages/com.ivanmurzak.unity.mcp/Editor/Scripts/McpServerManager.cs` (decoupled from the plugin `Version`). **Server version pin:** bumping the consumed server = changing that constant; the pinned `v<ServerVersion>` release (with all 7 RID zips) must already exist on GameDev-MCP-Server BEFORE cutting a plugin release that pins it.

## Build / Run
